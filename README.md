# Supertrend DEMA Simulation

## Project Overview
This repository contains data generated from simulations that use **Supertrend** and **Double Exponential Moving Averages (DEMA)** across different timeframes. The timeframes considered are 15-minute, 30-minute, and 1-hour candlestick charts. The data is saved in `.csv` files for further analysis.

## Files
The following files represent different configurations of the DEMA strategy applied to various candlestick timeframes:

## Description
The project simulates the performance of the **Supertrend** indicator in combination with various DEMA configurations to analyze market behavior across different timeframes. The `.csv` files contain the results of these simulations for use in further analysis, visualization, or backtesting.

## Timeframes
- **1-hour**
- **30-minute**
- **15-minute**

Each timeframe is paired with different DEMA periods (200, 600, and 800) to observe their respective performances under varying market conditions.

## How to Use
- Clone the repository and load the `.csv` files into your preferred data analysis tool (e.g., Python, Excel, R).
- Analyze the data or use it to backtest trading strategies that incorporate DEMA and Supertrend indicators.
